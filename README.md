## 🧠 About the Project

**VerifyNet** is a biometric authentication system that uses **deep learning** to verify human identity in real time. Unlike traditional face recognition systems that require large datasets to identify every new person, VerifyNet employs a **Siamese Neural Network** capable of making accurate identity decisions from a **single reference image** — a paradigm known as **one-shot learning**.

The system captures live webcam input, encodes facial features into high-dimensional embeddings, and computes similarity distances against a verified identity profile. This architecture mirrors the technology used in modern smartphones (like Apple Face ID) and enterprise-grade security systems.

This project was built end-to-end: from raw data collection and preprocessing, through model training and evaluation, to real-time deployment via a cross-platform **Kivy** desktop application.

## 📂 Dataset

The system uses **three categories** of images:

### 1. 🔗 Anchor Images
- Captured in real time via webcam
- Represent the **live input** during verification
- Collected using OpenCV's VideoCapture

### 2. ✅ Positive Images
- Also captured via webcam
- Represent the **enrolled identity** (the same person)
- Stored in `application_data/input_image/`

### 3. ❌ Negative Images
- Sourced from **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)** — an open Kaggle dataset
- Represent **different individuals** to train the model to reject
- Stored in `data/negative/`

> **Data Pairing Strategy:**
> - `(Anchor, Positive)` → Label: `1` (same person)
> - `(Anchor, Negative)` → Label: `0` (different person)

## 🧬 Model Design — Siamese Neural Network

The core of VerifyNet is a **Siamese Neural Network**, a specialized deep learning architecture designed for similarity learning.

### Why Siamese Networks?

Traditional classification networks require hundreds of examples per class. Siamese networks learn a *similarity function* — they don't memorize faces, they learn **how to compare them**. This enables:

- ✅ Verification with as **few as one enrollment image**
- ✅ Easy addition of new identities **without retraining**
- ✅ Robustness against unseen faces

### Architecture

   (Embedding Vector)
```

**Both branches share identical weights** — this is what makes it "Siamese" (twin networks).

### L1 Distance Layer (Custom Keras Layer)

```python
class L1Dist(Layer):
    def call(self, input_embedding, validation_embedding):
        return tf.math.abs(input_embedding - validation_embedding)
```

The absolute element-wise difference is passed to a final **Dense(1, sigmoid)** layer that outputs a similarity score between 0 and 1.

### Loss & Optimizer

| Component | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| **Loss Function** | Binary Cross-Entropy | Binary same/different labels |
| **Optimizer** | Adam | Adaptive learning rate, fast convergence |
| **Training Loop** | Custom `@tf.function` | Handles complex dual-input batches |

## 📡 Real-Time Verification Flow

The verification function simulates the logic behind **Apple Face ID**:

```python
def verify(model, detection_threshold=0.5, verification_threshold=0.6):
    """
    Runs 50 verification comparisons between webcam input
    and enrolled positive images. Returns VERIFIED if enough
    comparisons pass both thresholds.
    """
    results = []
    for image in os.listdir('application_data/verification_images'):
        input_img  = preprocess('application_data/input_image/input_image.jpg')
        val_img    = preprocess(os.path.join('application_data/verification_images', image))
        result     = model.predict([input_img, val_img])
        results.append(result)

    # Detection: how many comparisons exceeded 0.5 confidence?
    detection = np.sum(np.array(results) > detection_threshold)

    # Verification: did enough comparisons pass? (e.g., 30 out of 50)
    verification = detection / len(os.listdir('application_data/verification_images'))
    verified = verification > verification_threshold

    return results, verified
```

| Threshold | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Detection Threshold** | 0.5 | Minimum model confidence to count a match |
| **Verification Threshold** | 0.6 | Minimum ratio of passed comparisons to confirm identity |

## 📊 Performance Metrics

Model performance is evaluated using metrics appropriate for biometric authentication:

| Metric | Description | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Precision** | Of all "verified" predictions, how many were correct? | High (minimize false accepts) |
| **Recall** | Of all true positives, how many were caught? | High (minimize false rejects) |
| **F1 Score** | Harmonic mean of precision and recall | Maximized |

> In security-critical systems, **False Accept Rate (FAR)** must be minimized — the model should never verify an impostor. The threshold configuration allows tuning this trade-off based on the deployment context.
